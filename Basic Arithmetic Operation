This is a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used the Visual Studio Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this program because it displays the output seamlessly.

No Python libraries or modules were imported, as basic arithmetic operations can be performed using Python's built-in operators without any additional imports.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. It calculates the results for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
3. For division, the program checks if the second number is zero to avoid a division error.
4. Finally, it displays the results of all operations.
